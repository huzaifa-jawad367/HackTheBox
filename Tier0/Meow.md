After the VPN file is downloaded we use the following command to initialize the model:

```
sudo openvpn starting_point_HuzaifaJawad367.ovpn
```

If you see the following output your VPN has been setup successfully.
We then refresh the webpage to continue to our tasks and press the `spawn machine` button.
